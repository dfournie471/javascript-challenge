## Notes on Development and Use
This javascript application is designed to filter the table provided with user inputs. The website is simple to use. Simply input into the forms which filters you would like to use. Filtering can be done on one form, all of the forms, or any number of forms in between. THE DATE MUST BE INPUT AS: M/D/YYYY. STATE MUST BE INPUT AS ABBREVIATION. COUNTRY MUST ALSO BE ABBREVIATED (see form place holders as guide for input). The date range available is 1/1/2010-1/13/2013. For the other forms, you can enter the filter however you want. In order for the filter to execute, click the filter button. If the filters do not exist, the website will display a blank table. If this happens, simply click the Reset button and start over. Since the app.js alters the table elements in the html file, it produces a new table for each filter. This presents a problem if you want to continue filtering after the initial filter. However a simple fix has been provided. Simply click the reset button to reset the table. I hope you can find out some new facts about alien sightings! <br><br>

## Files Included
The static folders contains every file necessary for the app excluding the html. The css and data.js files were premade files for this assignment. The images folder contains the images used on the website, the css folder contains the css file used for styling, and the js folder contains the javascript app as well as the table used in the website. <br><br>
